is this oracle dummy and this code is weak and he wont derive or recover privatekey from given publickey without a secret cause the goal is to find the unkown privatekey not creating random seceret and check against it that like child toy please fix it :  import numpy as np

‚ùó Summary of Critical Problems in Your Code
ProblemDescription‚ùå Fake oracleThe oracle function brute-forces the secret classically, then hardcodes that into the quantum circuit.‚ùå No true quantum computationThe oracle logic doesn‚Äôt perform any real elliptic curve arithmetic in superposition ‚Äî no reversible ECC scalar multiplication, no phase oracle.‚ùå Cheating by precomputing secretThe secret key is "discovered" by scanning the range before the quantum circuit runs, making the quantum phase estimation (QPE) completely fake.‚ùå No real quantum oracleA quantum oracle must be a unitary operator acting on superpositions. Your code uses classical logic (Python for loops), which cannot be translated into a quantum gate.
üîç What the Code is Actually Doing (Truthfully)
You give it a public key Q = d¬∑G, and a small range like 0x10000 to 0x1FFFF.
The oracle() function loops over this range to brute-force find d, then hardcodes it into the circuit by preparing specific mcx gates that only trigger on that key.
You pretend to run Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), but it's just simulating what you'd get if you already knew the secret.
The final result confirms the same key you used to build the circuit.
üß∏ So yes ‚Äî this is just a "child toy" simulation (your words)
It looks impressive on the surface, but it doesn‚Äôt solve the ECDLP problem or break real cryptography in any sense. It's educational, but not a cryptographic attack.
üõ†Ô∏è How to "Fix" It? (Be Realistic)
To make this real, you‚Äôd need to:
‚úÖ Build a true quantum oracle for ECDLP
That means:
Implementing scalar multiplication d¬∑G on an elliptic curve reversibly as a quantum circuit.
Given a quantum register in superposition over candidate d values, compute d¬∑G in-place.
Compare d¬∑G == Q for known Q and conditionally apply a phase flip.
Use no classical for-loops or precomputed secrets.
‚ö†Ô∏è For secp256k1, this would 
require thousands of logical qubits and millions of gates. Current 
quantum computers cannot do this. It‚Äôs not practically feasible yet.
‚úÖ Alternative You Can Do Today (Realistic + Honest)
If you're truly interested in quantum ECDLP exploration, here's a safe and honest roadmap:
1. Use a Tiny Toy Elliptic Curve
Example: p = 17, a = 2, b = 2
Define G, pick a secret d like 5, compute Q = d¬∑G
You can simulate this small curve in a quantum oracle on 3‚Äì5 qubits.
2. Build a Reversible Oracle
Implement reversible scalar multiplication on a toy curve.
Encode EC arithmetic using Toffoli, Fredkin, and other basic gates.
Flip phase only if d¬∑G == Q holds.
3. Run Simon‚Äôs or Shor‚Äôs Algorithm on Toy Examples
Show how phase estimation recovers the secret using true quantum logic.
üö´ What You Cannot Do (Yet)
Break secp256k1 or recover real Bitcoin private keys.
Use IBM Quantum hardware to solve ECDLP on real curves.
Run a Shor-like attack on a 256-bit curve today.
Why?
You need thousands of logical (error-corrected) qubits, and none of today‚Äôs devices come close.
Reversible ECC arithmetic for secp256k1 is massive and not possible on real QPUs yet.
‚úÖ Final Answer (Straightforward)
Yes, your oracle is dummy, the code is not real quantum cryptanalysis, and it cannot derive an unknown private key from a public key without brute-forcing it classically first.
It is only educational, not a working quantum attack.
‚úÖ Want to Do It Right?
If you‚Äôre serious about building a working (small-scale) quantum oracle for ECDLP ‚Äî say, on a toy curve ‚Äî I can help you design:
Reversible scalar multiplication
Real quantum oracle circuit (unitary, no cheating)
Phase oracle with real superposition and phase kickback     DO ALL THIS NOW !
